## Introduction

Hello, I'm Aiden, I am currently in 10th grade. I love to play sports, hang out with friends when I have time, and trying new things. I attend school at Chatsworth Charter High School, and the first year was pretty good.

During this summer I had so much free time, I went to different places and tried things I havent tried before. This summer I had host foreign studnet, and every single day we were active. I hosted 2 French kids, Robert and Gabin, also a Spanish kid, Jaime. With Robert I went to Mammoth Lakes, and we spent time doing a lot of outdoor events and sports, like moutain biking and rock climbing. With Jaime and Gabin, we went to Palm Spring, We mostly Worked out over there, golfed, and went swimming because it was 100+ degrees outside. When we werent on vacation we would go to Hollywood area, Beverly Hills, and the gym just to hangout in those places. I would say spending time with all of them were very memorable and I would 100% not forget them. We almost played many sports, like Football, Futbol, Basketball, Golf, Swimming, etc. 

When the foreign students were gone or not here, I spent most of my time hanging out with friends and family. This summer I spent so much time with my friends. We went to amusement parks, regualar parks, the mall, and just random walking distance places. Somedays we would spend most of out night at our friends house swimming and working out until very late. We would just binge watch random movies that we all decided on and just have fun over all. There are many cool stuff we did missout on like, going to concerts, Skyzone, and more, but this was a very special summer and the first time i've a summer like this.

The volunteer work I did over the summer was hosting the foreign kids, I got 45 hours for each one. I did this program not only because I needed to catch up on my hours, but to learn from each of them. All of them had a unique vibe to them, probably because some were older than others. One thing that they all had in common was that they all wanted to try new things, and wanted us to try a little bit of their culture. They got to be apart of some family traditions, which are just us partying until early morning, and getting together at random dates.
